# galyleo-examples
This is a set of examples designed to outline the capabilities of, and teach people how to use, Galyleo Dashboards with Jupyter Notebooks.  There are two sets of examples here: *Tutorial Examples*, which primarily show how to use the Galyleo client library in Python, and *Demonstrations*, which show interesting sample dashboards made with Galyleo, and some commentary.
# Structure of an Example
A Galyleo example will typically consist of three files, in one directory:
1. A Jupyter Notebook which calculates the tables used on the dashboard
2. A Galyleo Dashboard file, which contains the Notebook
3. A README file, which describes the example and what it's intended to show.
# Loading the Examples
The examples are all designed to be run in a JupyterLab environment, with the free and open-source Galyleo extension.  Every environment on any of the engageLively public Galyleo hubs has the Jupyter and Python code installed to run the examples out-of-the-box.  The Galyleo extension and the Galyleo libraries required to connect to the dashboard are still in Beta; when they are released they will be available for download and installation.  Please watch the engageLively site or set up for alerts.
# Tutorial Examples
Tutorial examples are in the subdirectory /tutorials.  They are typically very short, and illustrate a narrow pathway through the environment; the goal is that each tutorial will thoroughly teach one task.  Some tutorials will be missing either a Notebook or a Galyleo Dashboard file, depending on the skill being taught.
# Demonstration Examples
Demonstration examples are in the subdirectory /demos.  These are longer and more elaborate, and are designed to illustrate fully-fetured dashboards
