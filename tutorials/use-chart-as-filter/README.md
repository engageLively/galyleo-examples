# Using Charts as Filters
Every chart is inherently a filter; specifically, a select filter on the category, or x-axis of the chart.  In a map, for example,
this is used to select the region of the map that the user has clicked on; in a pie chart, the wedge.  This is used to drill down
on a data set and drive a detailed chart.
