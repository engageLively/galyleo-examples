# Creating Views
A View is a subset of a table.  These form the key building blocks for dashboards -- namely, making charts responsive to user actions
on filters.  While charts can and do use a raw table as a data source, _almost all_ charts -- and _all_ charts that respond to user
input -- use a view as a data source.  
In a View, columns are manually chosen -- and, importantly, ordered by the dashboard creator -- and rows are selected by filters.
Builtin filters are configured by the dashboard creator; most filters are widgets which the viewer manipulates.
