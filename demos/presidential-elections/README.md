# The Presidential Election Dashboard
The Cook Political Report maintains a database of US Presidential Elections, going from 1828-1920.  The election for every state
and year is in this database, with over 2000 individual state elections represented.  
This demonstration shows an interactive dashboard where every election is accessible through two mouse actions: moving the slider (or using the arrows on the slider) changes the year, and clicking on a state on the map shows the detail for that state and year in the charts on the left-hand side of the central map, and the chart in the lower right shows the voting history for the selected state. This latter chart shows interesting correlations over time between neighboring states.
The pie chart shows the nationwide vote for the selected year, and the meters show the electoral college vote for the selected year.
Some people have asked about the Moose logo over the right-hand meter (independent electoral vote).  This is the symbol of the Progressive "Bull Moose" Party of Teddy Roosevelt, the most succesful third party in American history.
The finished dashboard can be found at [Presidential Elections](https://galyleobeta.engagelively.com/public/galyleo/index.html?dashboard=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engageLively/galyleo-examples/main/demos/presidential-elections/elections.gd.json)
