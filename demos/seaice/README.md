# Polar Sea Ice Data Set
These are observations of polar sea ice extent collected by the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsidcorg/daily-sea-ice-extent-data and is replicated in seaice.csv.

## Using the Dashboard
The original data from the National Snow and Ice Center was daily records of ice extent; to this, we have added monthly summaries.  Selecting a hemisphere and month shows the monthly average extent for that month of the year over the life of the dataset; clicking on the chart shows the detail for that month and selected year.

## Viewing the Dashboard
The final dashboard can be viewed at [Sea Ice Dashboard](https://galyleobeta.engagelively.com/public/galyleo/index.html?dashboard=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/engageLively/galyleo-examples/main/demos/seaice/seaice.gd.json)



## Dataset Augmentation
The original dataset is augmented by Pandas operations in seaice.ipynb.
