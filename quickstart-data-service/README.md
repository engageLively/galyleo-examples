# Using the Galyleo Data Service
In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the use of the Galyleo Data Service API.  Specifically, we will show how to:
1. Create an SDML table from a CSV File
2. Query the SDML table in a Jupyter Notebook
3. Publish the SDML table to the Galyleo Data Service
4. Query the published table

This Readme file is brief because the example is self-explanatory.  Open Notebook.ipynb and start running it.  You may need to change `domain` to reflect the domain of your Galyleo Hub
